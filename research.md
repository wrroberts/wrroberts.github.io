{% include section.html header="Evolutionary genomics in diatoms" %}

Diatoms are one of the most species-rich and diverse lineages of microbial eukaryotes. The order Thalassiosirales represents a lineage of centric diatoms that have made the transition from marine to freshwater habitats multiple times. To understand the genomic and genetic processes involved in the marine to freshwater transition, I have sequenced complete genomes and transcriptomes from across the order. We will use these genomes in multiple ways, including: (1) the estimation of phylogenomic relationships, (2) the evolutionary dynamics of repetitive elements, and (3) the impacts of genome duplication and gene family evolution. We have already released an updated version of the *Cyclotella cryptica* genome assembled using Nanopore long reads ([Roberts et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1534/g3.120.401408)) and will be releasing additional Thalassiosirales genomes.

While diatoms are predominantly photosynthetic, there are examples of species where photosynthesis has been lost. We sequenced and annotated the first genome of a nonphotosynthetic diatom (*Nitzschia* sp. Nitz4; [Onyshchenko et al. 2021](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/nph.17673)). We found the loss of photosynthesis-related genes, evidence for the remodeling of mitochondrial glycolysis to maximize ATP yield, and evidence for the presence of a Î²-ketoadipate pathway.

This work formed the basis of my doctoral dissertation. *Achimenes* is a small genus of 26 species native to Mexico and Central America that contains enormous variation in floral form that is closely tied to pollinator preferences. I sequenced, assembled, and annotated the floral transcriptomes of 10 species of _Achimenes_. I used Phylogenomic methods to estimate species relationships and found evidence for introgression between species pairs with similar floral form and pollination syndromes ([Roberts and Roalson 2018](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ajb2.1058)). I also performed comparative analyses of gene expression and co-expression during flower development across the same species to identify pathways and genes relevant for flower diversification ([Roberts and Roalson 2017](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-017-3623-8), [Roberts and Roalson 2020](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.8778)).

{% include section.html header="Diversification patterns in Gesneriaceae" %}

The Gesneriaceae (African violet family) represents a large lineage (>3500 species) with an enormous amount of diversity, particularly in floral form and growth form. The family is known for its diverse flowers that are visited by a number of different pollinators, as well as containing a high number of epiphytes, lithophytes, and unifoliate plants. We constructed the largest dated phylogeny to date and found evidence for geography, floral form, and growth form influencing diversification in New World and Old World Gesneriaceae [(Roalson and Roberts 2016)](http://sysbio.oxfordjournals.org/content/65/4/662).
