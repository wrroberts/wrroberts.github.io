{% include section.html header="Flower evolution in <em>Achimenes</em> (Gesneriaceae)" %}

This work formed the basis of my doctoral dissertation. *Achimenes* is a small genus of 26 species native to Mexico and Central America that contains enormous variation in floral form that is closely tied to pollinator preferences. I sequenced, assembled, and annotated the floral transcriptomes of 10 species of _Achimenes_. First, I performed comparative analyses of gene expression during flower development and species to identify pathways and genes relevant for flower diversification ([Roberts and Roalson 2017](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-017-3623-8), [Roberts and Roalson 2020](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.8778)). Second, I performed phylogenomic analyses to estimate species relationships and understand patterns of introgression [Roberts and Roalson 2018](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ajb2.1058)).

The Gesneriaceae (African violet family) represents a large lineage (>3500 species) with an enormous amount of diversity, particularly in floral form and growth form. The family is known for its diverse flowers that are visited by a number of different pollinators, as well as containing a high number of epiphytes, lithophytes, and unifoliate plants. We constructed the largest dated phylogeny to date and found evidence for geography, floral form, and growth form influencing diversification in New World and Old World Gesneriaceae [(Roalson and Roberts 2016)](http://sysbio.oxfordjournals.org/content/65/4/662).
